# 1. Relational Databases
- model data by storing rows and columns in tables.
- their power lies in the ability to retrieve the data from those tables in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationship between those tables involved in the query.

## Terminology

- __database__ - contains many tables; it's both, a storage and software.
- __relation (or table)__ - contains tuples and attributes. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organised into rows and columns.
- __tuple (or row)__ - a set of fields that generally represents an "object".
- __attribure (also column or field)__ - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row. 

# 2. Using Databases
- __Database Model or Schema__ is a structure or format of the database, is the application of a data model when used in conjunction with the database management system. It's a contract about the shape of what we are going to store and retrieve in our database.

__CRUD__ - create, read, update, delete
